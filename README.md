I bought the [canonni.website](https://canonni.website) domain in mid 2024 for a whopping sum of $20. Why .website? Because it's, shocklingly, you know, a website, and because registration fees for niche TLDs are slightly cheaper than .com. After setting up [my blog](https://blog.canonni.website), I wrote some simple HTML at 2am and alled it a day; some of its contents are still stored on [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240901163441/http://canonni.website/), but the rest are lost to history, probably for the better.

A few months later, while googling my own name for... reasons, I decided to do a proper makeover using simple some React, creating [this monstrosity](https://old.canonni.website) that barely even worked. This survived surprisingly long, and it would be half a year before I realized its ugliness, watched two Vue tutorials, and spent half a day making [this... design?](https://web.archive.org/web/20250514212102/http://canonni.website/)

I honestly don't know what I was going for, but I'm glad I came to my senses and did a redesign a couple months later, making the design used now. After realizing I'm not smart enough to view Vue, I rewrote the website with React again. Literally nothing changed apart from the Vue source code being moved to `/archive` in a massive git commit.

I might do a total makeover in the future, or even scrap the website entirely since it only gets a dozen or so visits a month. But at least for now, canonni.website is my website.
